# Exercise

This is the completed archive at this stage:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/gomix-playlist-4>

It can be imported into gomix using `edeleastar/gomix-playlist-4`

## Exercise 1

Test the application more comprehensively - signing up a range of users, and creating playlists. Make sure the users only see the playlists they have created.


## Exercise 2

Look at the `authenticate` method again:

~~~
  authenticate(request, response) {
    const user = userstore.getUserByEmail(request.body.email);
    if (user) {
      response.cookie('playlist', user.email);
      logger.info(`logging in ${user.email}`);
      response.redirect('/dashboard');
    } else {
      response.redirect('/login');
    }
  },
~~~

Can you see anything not quite right about it? 

Hint: what happens if incorrect password entered? Try this now.

See if you can fix this problem - i.e. only allow user to log in if they provide correct password.

## Exercise 3

Version 3 of the Gomark assignment can be downloaded from here:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/gomark-3>

In Gomix, create a new project, and import from github: `edeleastar/gomark-3`.

Using this lab as a guide - see if you can introduce sessions into gomark?

## Exercise 4

You should still have your own gomark assignment. Try this same now - bringing in the sessions feature into your solution.
