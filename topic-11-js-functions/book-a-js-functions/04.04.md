# Function Parameters & Scope I

### Function Parameters

So far our functions have not been taking in any input; they simply are returning an output. So when would we want an input to our functions? Let's imagine we want to calculate the sum of two numbers. If our numbers are 5 and 5, well, that's easy.

~~~
5 + 5; // 10
~~~

But what happens if we don't know what our numbers are? How could we possibly do this? Better yet, what if we want to do 4 + 6, and 2 + 8 and 7 + 3...we would have to start writing a whole bunch of code that's does basically the same function. This is a great example of when we want to add inputs and use a function. Inputs to a function are called _parameters_ or _arguments_.

So what does a function look like with parameters? Let's write a function called `add` that takes in two parameters - `number1` and `number2` - and returns their sum.

~~~
function add(number1, number2){
    return number1 + number2;
}
~~~

Now our add function will work for any two numbers that we want to add together. It's important to note that the name of the paramters, `number1` and `number2`, are arbitrary names that we have chosen. If we change the names of the parameters to `a` and `b`, the function would do exactly the same thing:

~~~
// This function will do the same thing as our previous function
function add(a, b){
    return a + b;
}
~~~

Now we can define a function with parameters. Let's see how we _invoke_ that function:

~~~
add(4, 6); // returns 10
add(2, 8); // returns 10
add(7, 1); // returns 8
~~~

In the example above, we are now invoking the add function with parameters. A parameter can be a literal number like we have above, or we could even use variables:

~~~
var num1 = 5;
var num2 = 8;
add(num1, num2);  // returns 13
~~~

It is important to understand that the variable names we are using when we invoke the function are not related at all to the variable names we have defined _inside_ of the function. The values of `num1` and `num2` are being copied into the parameters `number1` and `number2` that are defined in the function.

### Function Scope

Now that we have an idea of what functions do, let's talk about what happens when we define variables inside of functions. To do that, we first need to define what `scope` is.

MDN defines `scope` as "The context in which values and expressions are 'visible,' or can be referenced". In JavaScript (before ES2015, which is where we will start), there are only 2 kinds of scope: _global scope_ and _function scope_.

The important takeaways here are

1.  **all variables that are defined outside of functions (and inside of functions without the `var` keyword) are declared in the global scope, and**

2.  **all variables defined inside of functions can only be accessed by those functions (and any inner functions)**.

Let's see an example.

~~~
var globalVariable = "I live in the global scope";

function makeNewScope(){
    var functionScopeVariable = "I live in the scope of the makeNewScope function";
}

globalVariable; // "I live in the global scope";
makeNewScope(); // maybe this will define the functionScopeVariable...

functionScopeVariable; // This gives us an error! To be specific, a ReferenceError because the functionScopeVariable is not defined.

~~~

What happens when we remove the `var` keyword?

~~~
// Since thise variable declaration is in the global scope, it will
// be a globalVariable with or without the var keyword.  It is a best
// practice to always use the var keyword though.
globalVariable = "I live in the global scope";

function makeNewScope(){
    // You do not want to do this in practice.  You should
    // always defined your variables with the var keyword.
    functionScopeVariable = "What happens now?";
}

globalVariable; // "I live in the global scope"
makeNewScope(); // now this will define the functionScopeVariable!

// The value of the variable will be "What happens now?"
functionScopeVariable;
~~~

If we omit the `var` keyword inside of a function, we actually declare that variable in the global scope. While this may seem like the way to go, this is not best practice. If we need to change some variable in a function, we should at least declare it in the global scope and assign it in a function so that our code is more readable.

~~~
var globalVariable = "I live in the global scope";

// we are just declaring the variable now; its value will be set to undefined.
var globalVariableToBeChanged;

function makeNewScope() {
    // Here we are assigning the value "What happens now" to the
    // globalVariableToBeChanged variable.
    globalVariableToBeChanged = "Undefined no more!";
}

globalVariable; // "I live in the global scope"
makeNewScope(); // now this will assign a new value to the globalVariableToBeChanged!

// The value of globalVariableToBeChanged is "Undefined no more!"
globalVariableToBeChanged;
~~~
