# Solution

This is the completed application:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/gomix-image-store>

If you are in Gomix - import the project from github: `edeleastar/gomix-image-store` 

# Exercise 1: Download and run Locally

Download the project and run it on our own workstation. Remember, after downloading you must run:

~~~
npm install
~~~

from inside the project folder, and then run:

~~~
npm start
~~~

to run. Browse to

- <http://localhost:4000/>

to see it in action. Experiment with uploading some pictures. However, you must have your own .env file locally if this to work:

## .env.json

~~~
{
  "cloudinary": {
    "cloud_name": "YOURID",
    "api_key": "YOURKEY",
    "api_secret": "YOURSECRET"
  }
}
~~~
